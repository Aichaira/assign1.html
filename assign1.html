        <p style="color:white; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Throne of Glass is the first book of a series of 8 books.</p> 
        <p style="color:white; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;"> In a land without magic, an assassin is summoned to the castle. She has no love for the vicious king who rules from his throne of glass, but she has not come to kill him. She has come to win her freedom. If she defeats twenty-three murderers, thieves, and warriors in a competition, she will be released from prison to serve as the King's Champion.</p>
        <p style="color:white; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">Her name is Celaena Sardothien.</p>
        <p style="color:white; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">The Crown Prince will provoke her. The Captain of the Guard will protect her. And a princess from a faraway country will befriend her. But something rotten dwells in the castle, and it's there to kill. When her competitors start dying mysteriously, one by one, Celaena's fight for freedom becomes a fight for survival-and a desperate quest to root out the evil before it destroys her world.</p>

        <p style="color:white; font-family:'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">I greatly enjoy this series because of how well it was written. 
            Almost every character that is given a name has a purpose and helps in some way to tie the whole story together, whether that character be a child who died 30 years prior, or an overgrown spider who worships an evil demon. 
            All the questions that appear during the series always get solved at some point, even if it takes until the very last page. 
            I was never a fan of romance stories, but I thought that all the romances in this series made sense and were clearly not put there just to fill blank pages. 
            Even if I sometimes died inside reading the character interactions.</p>
